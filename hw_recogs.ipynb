    "This assignment is about _compositional generalization_. We are going to assess the degree to which our apparently very good models have learned to process and interpret language _systematically_. To do this, we are going to ask them to interpret novel combinations of familiar words and phrases. For humans, these tasks are very easy. For our models, the situation seems to be quite different.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis for the assignment is the ReCOGS dataset of [Wu, Manning, and Potts 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13716). ReCOGS modifies the COGS dataset of [Kim and Linzen 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.731) in a number of ways, with the goal of more directly assessing the interpretive abilities of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment questions are fairly diverse. Question 1 asks you to conduct a specific analysis of the ReCOGS dataset, and Question 2 follows this up with a corresponding analysis of the errors made by a top-performing ReCOGS model. For Question 3, you try some in-context learning with DSP. And then we open things up as usual: you can do anything you want for your original system, and you enter that system's predictions into a bakeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one rule that we need to enforce throughout this work:\n",
    "\n",
    "__You cannot train your system on any examples from `dataset[\"gen\"]`, nor can the output representations from those examples be included in any prompts used for in-context learning.__\n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of your original system is otherwise unconstrained."

For example, in the `obj_to_subj_proper` category, models encounter proper names that appeared in the train set only in grammatical object position (e.g., _see Sandy_), and then they are asked to make predictions about cases where those names are grammatical subjects (_Sandy left_). These changes have systematic effects on the grammatical roles that the meanings of these names play semantically. In particular, subjects are likely to play `agent` roles and objects are likely to play `theme` roles."
