The general idea behind this model is that we can train a model to do "advanced" multi-span QA on large documents.
The main advantage of such an approach would be to teach the model to link documents, and not learn to detect 
specific words. A real-world advantage of this would be that these lists evolve often, and we do not expect
re-training of the models to be necessary following evolutions of these scorecards. 
In addition, this would perhaps allow the model to generalise to tasks beyond pesticide and fertilizer verifications,
and perhaps tackle other tasks such as nematicide or fungicide detections.
