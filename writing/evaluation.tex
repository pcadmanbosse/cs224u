We evaluate the models using two metrics. First, we measure the ROUGE score of the proposed and base models. 
Because this metric will place more biais than desired on correct "formatting" of the answers, i.e. following the "Pesticide X was found on plots A, B", rather than the factual accuracy of the labels X, A and B, we also extract these fields from the answers using regex and measure the F1-Score.
